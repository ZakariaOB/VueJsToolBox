- To install elements : npm i element-ui -S
- You can change the general options : font-size, font-color
- CHECK WHY YOU SHOULD ALWYAS ADD .vue TO THE IMPORTS
    import  EvCollapsibleChk
          from '@/components/custom-components/ev-collapsible-chk/ev-collapsible-chk.vue';
 => !!!!!!!!!!!!! Compare the imports bewteen your project and Everest => WEIRD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

- To use jquery with typescript => npm install --save-dev @types/jquery

- The issue with the collapsible component was an initial class to put as : 'collapse' (Bootsrap thing propbably)
  Another think to verify later is with @Watch . Apperently the @Watch is not working on the init of the components
  as I had the impression . But it will listen to the change of the prop coming from other components .
  => TO CHECK IN AN EXAMPLE

- Smart selection : You are looking for Shrink/Expand Selection.
    Trigger it with Shift+Alt+Left and Shift + Alt+Right
    Update:
    This is now called Smart select API. This feature uses
    semantic knowledge to intelligently expand selections for expressions, types,
    statements, classes, and imports.

- From directives used for form group build
    - When clicking on a button, execute the first event handler,
      and stop the rest of the event handlers from being executed .
    - The Event interface's preventDefault() method tells the user agent that if the event does not get explicitly handled,
      its default action should not be taken as it normally would be
    - Propagation as an example is a button handling multiple clic events
        > var x = document.getElementById("myBtn");
          x.addEventListener("click", myFunction);
          x.addEventListener("click", someOtherFunction);

- Blur means simply loosing focus .
- The blur event fires when an element has lost focus. The main difference between this event
  and focusout is that focusout bubbles while blur does not.
