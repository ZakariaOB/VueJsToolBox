- Always avoid using logic inside the subscripbtions => The idea is to use operators as much as
  possible .
- $source => $ is used for observables .
- To check types conversions on typescript
- ShareReply : Share the result of a stream between different subscriptions
- tap(): Side effect on our observable chain .

- One idea with the concat operator is that it will never complete
  if one of the chained observables has not completed .

- MergeMap   : all observables merged could run in parallel
  ConcatMap  : The current observable should complete before executing (subscribing) the next one
  exhaustMap : Button example > No observable is considered before the completion of the current one
               It will not be scheduled to run after completion of the previous on unlike ConcatMap
